# S4-HW-CODE-QUIZ
This Assignment had us bulding a timed quiz of multiple choice questions that could accurately tell if the user correctly answered each question as well as persist data corresponding to a user and thier score. I acheaved this by having an array of quiz questions saved directly on to the Javascript file, and setting up a framework HTML page that would be used to place each question, answer, and user score in a corresponding section. After query selecting all the neccisary elements the page was setup to place and style different elements in such a way that would accurately move the user from question to question and screen by either changing the inner HTML for each new question or by collapsing the display and pushing to the back the division of portions not currently being used. Time was kept by having a function subtract from a global variable every second after the quiz was started. A score was kept by incrementing a global variable everytime the correct answer element was the target of an onclick event. Data was persisted by saving an object onto local storage and pushing a new version of that object every time a name and score was added to the local array containing those variables. In the end I cut the responsive message element that would signify a correct or incorrect response every time one was submited but left the correct option labeled in the array so users could see how the time is decremented every time an inccorect answerr is given.
